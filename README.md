# FlappyBirdGame 
A simple Flappy Bird game implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller with an OLED display and a push-button for controls.
This project uses an ESP32, an SSD1306 OLED display, and a push button to recreate the classic Flappy Bird game. The bird moves through obstacles, and you control it by pressing the button to "flap" and keep it in the air.

## Hardware Requirements
1. ESP32 (DevKit V1 or similar)
2. 0.96-inch OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)
3. Push Button 
4. Buzzer (Optional for sound effects)
5. Breadboard & Jumper Wires
   
##Troubleshooting
ðŸ›‘ Common Issues & Fixes
# OLED screen stays blank?
1. Check wiring (SDA, SCL connections).
2. Try changing the I2C address (default: 0x3C).
#Compilation Errors?
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Make sure .h files are in the same directory.
#ESP32 not detected?
1. Try a different USB cable/port.
2. Check if the correct COM Port is selected.
