# FlappyBirdGame 
A simple Flappy Bird game implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller with an OLED display and a push-button for controls.
This project uses an ESP32, an SSD1306 OLED display, and a push button to recreate the classic Flappy Bird game. The bird moves through obstacles, and you control it by pressing the button to "flap" and keep it in the air.

1.ESP32 (DevKit V1 or similar)
2.0.96-inch OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)
